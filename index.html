<h1>People Change Either Because They've Been Broken by What No Longer Fulfills Them, or Because They've Finally Awakened to What Truly Calls Them</h1>
<p>I thought I'd be a scientist all my life—a real scientist. White coat, safety glasses, gloves. Working on something big. Something world-changing. Something meaningful.</p>
<p>But behind every push to move away from science—“I honestly never felt like one. It took me hours to grasp the theory, and more effort than most just to study for an exam”—there was always a quiet pull: “I've been in science for 10 years. My parents are so proud of where I am. They'll be disappointed if I walk away.”</p>
<p>Then, I was let go from my job.</p>
<p>And oddly… I felt relieved. A weight lifted, even with the uncertainty of being jobless. Because deep down, I knew: The routine had stopped feeling like a rhythm. It had become a cage.</p>
<p>For some, that realization creeps in slowly—on the morning commute, over another unread email.
For others, it hits all at once, like a wave of “this can't be it.”
That wave hit me hard.</p>
<p>Comfort is easy—but purpose runs deeper.
And yes, chasing what feels like just an idea is rarely smooth.
There's no roadmap, no promises, no guaranteed paychecks.
But staying in a life where you no longer feel alive?
That's the quietest kind of loss.</p>
<p>In the back of my mind, I knew this was my window—maybe the last one.
Leap now… or shut the coffee dream out for good.</p>
<p>But how do you even begin?</p>
<p>———</p>
<h3>☕ The Coffee Dream</h3>
<p>One day, I typed into Google: “Where is coffee grown?” Brazil. Colombia.</p>
<p>Is it safe to travel solo?<br/>
How long should I go for?<br/>
What about the language barrier?<br/>
What's the plan?</p>
<p>Every question was a reason to talk myself out of it.</p>
<p>Until I shared the idea with a friend: “Let's go. I'm down to go to Colombia for a week, get you settled, then head back to San Diego. I went there years ago and would love to check it out again.”</p>
<p>And just like that, the trip began. A one-way ticket to Colombia.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to it, I started telling people—my family (who were convinced I was nuts), my best friends, my apartment mate.</p>
<p>I created a loose itinerary in Google Docs so friends could always know my location. I signed up for Worldpackers (volunteering in exchange for housing and maybe meals). I downloaded Couchsurfing and made sure to only stay with women or couples. I budgeted enough to travel for three months, made arrangements for someone to take care of my cat, downloaded a language app, and began brushing up on basic Spanish.</p>
<p>It was happening.<br/>
I was really doing a solo trip.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h3>☕ Laying the Foundation</h3>
<p>Before I left, I took a coffee tasting course at Memli Coffee Lab.</p>
<p>I learned how to slurp (yes, slurping is real in coffee tasting!), picked up tasting notes, roast profiles, and how to pair coffee with food. I even got introduced to the SCA score sheet—used globally to evaluate coffee quality, guided by a community that values sustainability and education. That course lit a fire in me. It made the dream feel tangible. Possible.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h3>🌍 Life on the Road</h3>
<p>Here's something they don't tell you about solo travel: everything is up in the air.</br>
You plan… but you don't really know.</br>
You live day by day.</br>
Opportunities show up out of nowhere.</br> 
People are kind to offer help</br>
Plans change...ALL THE TIME</p>
<p>By the end of the first month, my favorite phrase became:</p>
<p>“Yeah, let's do it.”</p>
<p>And honestly? That mindset changed everything.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h3>✨ The Takeaway</h3>
<p>Change doesn't always come wrapped in clarity. Sometimes, it shows up disguised as failure, confusion, or even fear.</p>
<p>But if you feel that pull—that longing to do something different, something meaningful—don't ignore it.</p>
<p>You don't need all the answers. You just need enough courage to take the first step.</p>
<p>Because people change—
either because they've been broken by what no longer fulfills them…</br>
or because they've finally awakened to what truly calls them.</p>
