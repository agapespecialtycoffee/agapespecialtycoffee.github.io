<h1>People Change Either Because They’ve Been Broken by What No Longer Fulfills Them, or Because They’ve Finally Awakened to What Truly Calls Them</h1>
<p>I thought I’d be a scientist all my life—a real scientist. White coat, safety glasses, gloves. Working on something big. Something world-changing. Something meaningful.</p>
<p>But behind every push to move away from science—“I honestly never felt like one. It took me hours to grasp the theory, and more effort than most just to study for an exam”—there was always a quiet pull: “I’ve been in science for 10 years. My parents are so proud of where I am. They’ll be disappointed if I walk away.”</p>
<p>Then, I was let go from my job.</p>
<p>And oddly… I felt relieved. A weight lifted, even with the uncertainty of being jobless.
Because deep down, I knew:
The routine had stopped feeling like a rhythm. It had become a cage.</p>
